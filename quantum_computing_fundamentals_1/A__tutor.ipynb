    "# PART 1: QUANTUM INTERFERENCE\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Quantum Interference?\n",
    "\n",
    "**In my own words:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum interference is when quantum states combine so that some results become stronger and some cancel out.  \n",
    "This helps a quantum computer hide wrong answers and make the correct answer stand out.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Z Gate\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does the Z gate do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z gate does not change the measurement result, but it changes the *phase*.  \n",
    "It leaves |0⟩ the same, but flips the sign of |1⟩.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect of Z gate:**\n",
    "\n",
    "|0⟩ → |0⟩  \n",
    "|1⟩ → −|1⟩  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The H-Z-H Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: First H gate does...**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first H gate puts the qubit into a superposition.  \n",
    "The qubit becomes both |0⟩ and |1⟩ at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Z gate does...**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z gate adds a negative sign to the |1⟩ part of the superposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Second H gate does...**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second H gate combines the paths and causes interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The result is:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden phase change becomes visible in the final measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Does This Matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "**How is interference used in quantum algorithms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum algorithms use interference to cancel wrong answers and amplify correct ones.  \n",
    "This is how quantum computers extract useful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Something that clicked for me about interference:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computers don’t just try many answers — they remove bad answers using interference.\n",

    "## ❓ Questions I Still Have About Interference\n",
    "\n",

    "## The Problem It Solves\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the mystery box problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a function that is either constant or balanced.  \n",
    "We must figure out which type it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constant function means:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is always 0 or always 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balanced function means:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Half the outputs are 0 and half are 1.\n",

    "### Classical Computer Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**How many checks does a classical computer need?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case, it needs more than half of all inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why can't it do better?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it checks inputs one at a time.\n",

    "### Quantum Computer Approach\n",

    "**How many checks does a quantum computer need?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one.\n",

    "\n",
    "**If we measure |00⟩, this means:**  \n",
